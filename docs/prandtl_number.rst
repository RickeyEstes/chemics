Prandtl number
==============

The Prandtl number is a dimensionless number representing the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity. It is calculated from the following equation

.. math:: Pr = \frac{C_p\,\mu}{k}

where :math:`C_p` is specific heat as J/(kg⋅K), :math:`\mu` is dynamic viscosity as kg/(m⋅s), and :math:`k` is thermal conductivity with units of W/(m⋅K).
